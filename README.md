## A mod to make RimWorld loading screens look nice

See the [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884085308) page for a full description.

If you encounter issues, I would really appreciate knowing about them. You can reach me via several methods:
- I have a [dedicated discord server](https://discord.gg/https://discord.gg/3d8xvnBJgX) for my code projects, including BetterLoading.
- I'm in the [official RimWorld discord](https://discord.gg/rimworld) as `Samboy [BetterLoading]`, and you can mention me in the mod-general channel.
- You can DM me (Samboy#0063) on discord, I accept random friend requests.
- You can leave a comment on the steam workshop page (though these don't get checked quite as often)
- You can open an issue here on github, which will send a message to my discord server.
